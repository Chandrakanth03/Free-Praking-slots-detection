# Free Slot Detection Using OpenCV and Streamlit

## Overview
This project leverages OpenCV for detecting free parking slots and integrates it with a web interface using Streamlit. The goal is to provide a real-time solution for parking space management, where users can upload parking lot images or videos and view the number of available spaces directly on a web-based platform.

## Features
- Real-time detection of free parking slots in parking lot images and videos.
- Interactive web interface for uploading images and videos.
- Visual representation of free and occupied parking slots.
- Displays the count of free parking slots.
- Easy integration with user-uploaded content for dynamic slot detection.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit
