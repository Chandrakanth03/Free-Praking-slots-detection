Free Slot Detection Using OpenCV and Streamlit
Overview
This project leverages OpenCV for detecting free parking slots and integrates it with a web interface using Streamlit. The goal is to provide a real-time solution for parking space management, where users can upload parking lot images or videos and view the number of available spaces directly on a web-based platform.

Features
Real-time detection of free parking slots in parking lot images and videos.
Interactive web interface for uploading images and videos.
Visual representation of free and occupied parking slots.
Displays the count of free parking slots.
Easy integration with user-uploaded content for dynamic slot detection.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
NumPy
Streamlit
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
cd REPO-NAME
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy streamlit
Run the project:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application on your local server.

Usage
Open the web application in your browser (default URL: http://localhost:8501).
Use the web interface to upload parking lot images or videos.
The application will automatically detect the free parking slots and display the number of available spaces.
The visual representation will highlight the free and occupied slots in the uploaded media.
