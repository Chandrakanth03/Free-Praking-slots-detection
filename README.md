# Free Slot Detection Using OpenCV

## Overview
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect free parking slots in a designated area. The aim is to provide a real-time solution for parking space management, making it easier for drivers to find available spots.

## Features
- Real-time detection of free parking slots.
- Visual representation of detected slots.
- User-friendly interface for monitoring available spaces.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   cd REPO-NAME
2.Install the required dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy


3.Run the project:
python free_slot_detection.py

Usage
1.Make sure your camera is set up to capture the parking area.
2.Run the free_slot_detection.py script to start detecting available slots.
3.The output will display the parking slots with a visual indication of free and occupied slots.
